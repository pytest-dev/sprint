# pytest development sprint 2024

I'm happy to announce that in collaboration with [OMICRON](https://www.omicronenergy.com/en/), I ([@The-Compiler](https://github.com/the-compiler)) am organizing another pytest development sprint, taking place **June 17th to 21st**, with a social event on **June 22nd**.

[Discussions](https://github.com/pytest-dev/sprint/discussions) in this repository will be used for organizing various aspects. Feel free to contribute!

Back in 2016, we [had an amazing](https://blog.pytest.org/2016/pytest-development-sprint/) development sprint in Freiburg, Germany, with a [successful crowdfunding](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/python-testing-sprint-mid-2016#/) and 27 participants from five continents meeting up for a week, to hack on pytest 3.0 and tox.

That sprint is where things were implemented which you still likely see today: Renaming the `py.test` binary to `pytest`, the `--setup-only` and `--setup-plan` flags, `-o` to override options â€” and countless other features, bugfixes, and work on plugins.

In 2024, I'd like to repeat this, with the goal of having a nice mixture of newcomers, plugin authors, people who have worked on pytest itself before, and of course core developers.

From what things look like currently, @flub and @asottile would be in, and @Zac-HD as well as @RonnyPfannschmidt answered "maybe".

Given some generous support by OMICRON (one big and two small meeting rooms, reserved for the whole week), and given our [OpenCollective balance of ~$50k USD](https://opencollective.com/pytest), we will be able to host a maximum of 35 people. The details will still need to be discussed, but the idea is that we (partially/fully) **pay for travel and accommodation for participants** from pytest funds, and OMICRON will **offer free lunch** for all participants.

Before we flesh out all the details, I'd like to open up to a bigger audience: **If you might be interested in joining us**, please fill out this survey with your preferred date (link removed). Obviously nothing of this is binding for now. I'm just trying to figure out how many people we'd be likely need to budget for, before moving into the details.

# Venue

The sprint will be hosted by OMICRON in [Klaus, Vorarlberg, Austria](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/47.3075/9.6207). Klaus is inhabited by a whopping ~3000 people. Despite being somewhat in the middle of nowhere, it's actually not too hard to reach:

- **~2-2.5h from Zurich Airport**, either:
  - 1h 15min direct Eurocity to Bregenz, then 30min local train from there
  - 10min local train to Zurich main station, 1.5h direct Railjet to Feldkirch, 10min local train from there
- **~1.25h by train from Friedrichshafen**: Train to Lindau, train to Feldkirch, train to Klaus
- **~3h by train from Munich**: 2h direct Eurocity train to Bregenz, 30min local train to Klaus
- **~6.5h by train from Vienna**: just over 6h by direct train (Railjet), and then another 10 minutes in a local train

# Activities

Obviously, we'll hack a lot on pytest! Exact topics will still need to be discussed, but of course we can also sprint on whatever participants  find interesting, as long as it benefits pytest.

We'll make sure to spend time socializing as well obviously. No details here either just yet, but we might have an evening barbecue at OMICRON's venues, and go for a hike or two together while we're there!
